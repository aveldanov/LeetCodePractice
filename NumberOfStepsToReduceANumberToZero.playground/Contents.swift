/*
 Example 1:

 Input: num = 14
 Output: 6
 Explanation:
 Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7.
 Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
 Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3.
 Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2.
 Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
 Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
 Example 2:

 Input: num = 8
 Output: 4
 Explanation:
 Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4.
 Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2.
 Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
 Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
 Example 3:

 Input: num = 123
 Output: 12
