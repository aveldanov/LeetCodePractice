/*
 Write a function that given a BST, it will return the distance (number of edges) between 2 nodes.

 For example, given this tree

          5
         / \
        3   6
       / \   \
      2   4   7
     /         \
    1           8
 The distance between 1 and 4 is 3: [1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4]

 The distance between 1 and 8 is 6: [1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8]
